Exciting News! I am thrilled to announce that I will be participating in a [workshop](https://www.santannapisa.it/en/icra-2023-workshop-small-scale-medical-robots) at ICRA 2023 in London, where I'll have the opportunity to present a talk on my research, titled "Collaborative Magnetic Manipulation: From Micro to Meso Scale."

This workshop is all about the latest in small-scale medical robots. The incredible progress in developing tiny robots capable of operating inside the human body is truly noteworthy. The event will bring together experts from the fields of robotics, science, and medicine.

I'm excited to share my work and hear from top experts during the "Flash Talks" session.
