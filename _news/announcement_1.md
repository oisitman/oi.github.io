I am excited to announce that I recently presented our paper at the International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2022. For those who couldn't attend or wish to revisit, the presentation video is available for viewing. Additionally, for a more in-depth exploration of our findings, you can find the full paper provided at the end of this post.


#### Research Highlights:
Our research is focused on a novel cooperative manipulation method for a non-contact robotic electromagnetic needle manipulation system. The key features of our system include:
<ul>
<li>Over-actuated Manipulator: We utilize two robotic electromagnetic needles, each with 3 degrees of freedom (DOF). This setup allows us to manipulate a microparticle to any position within the planar workspace, approaching from any direction.</li>
<li>
Optimization-based Control: Our system's redundant DOFs, combined with an optimal control approach, enable accurate path following. This design also helps in preventing needle collisions. </li>

<li>
Precision and Accuracy: Through visual servoing, our controller has demonstrated follwoing accuracy levels:
<ul>
      <li>Line Following: 0.33 ± 0.32 μm</li>
      <li>Square Following: 0.77 ± 0.55 μm</li>
      <li> Circle Following: 0.89 ± 0.66 μm </li>
</ul>
 

These measurements were achieved with a 4.5 μm diameter superparticle.
</li>

</ul>

We are grateful for the opportunity to share our work with the global robotics community and look forward to advancing our research further.
