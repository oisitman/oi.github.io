Exciting News! I am happy to announce that I will be presenting our work "Trajectory Optimization for Magnetic Capsule Endoscopy" in a [workshop](https://sites.google.com/view/rami-icra-2024-workshop/home?authuser=0) at ICRA 2024 in Yokohama, Japan!

The aim of this workshop is to bring together active research groups and clinicians, sharing the latest technological achievements in the field of robot-assisted medical imaging. By gathering world-class technical and clinical researchers, the meaningful discussion on the remaining challenges beyond technical developments like ethical issues and clinical acceptance will also be discussed during the one-day workshop.

Optimizing the capsule's trajectory enhances precision, imaging capability, and ensures the actuation system's effectiveness and patient safety. We propose a trajectory optimization method for magnetic capsule endoscopy using a single external permanent magnet (EPM) on a robotic arm and an internal permanent magnet (IPM). Our method employs a constrained iterative linear quadratic regulator (iLQR) to generate optimal trajectories that meet manipulation tasks and constraints for both magnets. Testing confirmed the method's effectiveness in constraint satisfaction, manipulability, and disturbance rejection, specifically for keeping stomach polyps within the field of view while avoiding collisions.
