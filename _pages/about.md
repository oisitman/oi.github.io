Hey there!üëã I‚Äôm currently on an exciting journey as a Ph.D. candidate at Aalto University, working at the Intelligent Robotics research group under the supervision of Prof. Ville Kyrki. Here, I‚Äôm diving deep into the world of robotic manipulation and magnetic navigation systems, all with a focus on making a difference in robotics in medical applications.

You can think of me as a bit of a tech enthusiast, with a knack for languages like Python, Matlab/Simulink, and C++. I love bringing intelligent systems to life and have had some awesome experiences designing and developing autonomous solutions.

In the academic realm, I'm all about automation, robotic manipulation, and crafting control systems that can tackle real-world challenges. It's all part of my mission to push the boundaries of robotics in healthcare technology.

I'm thrilled to share my projects and contributions with you here on my portfolio. Feel free to reach out.
